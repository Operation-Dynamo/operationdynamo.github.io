# About

**OperationDynamo** gets its name from the Little Ships of Dunkirk. We belive that like the _Operation Dynamo_ of the past, we too can rally a community to rescue lives. Our team was inspired by the OSCMS (Open Source COVID19 Medical Supplies) project, but while that project worked to build a list of makers, we are working to pair makers with their local hospitals. We are doing the leg work to build the relationships with as many hospitals as we can so that makers can do what they do best: make things!
