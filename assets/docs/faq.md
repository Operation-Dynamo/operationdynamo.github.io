# FAQ

Last Updated: **March 23, 2020**

## What are you building?
We take STL files that a hospital or doctor provides to us, and we pass it on to our network of makers. Each maker who signs up for a task is then responsible for delivery of any items built. Our platform will be able to connect makers to build ventilator parts, or face shields, or any other similar parts for those in need.

## Is this a free service?
Yes. There is no cost to using this service. We will run the site as long as we can!

## Can I be compensated for a print job?
Makers who use our site are volunteers. We have no means of compensating anyone for their time.

## Are you a registered charity?
No.

## Why do I need a referal code?
We want to be able to control the scale of the site.

## I would like to get a referal code or contact you personally?
Please send an email to [contact@operationdynamo.org](mailto:contact@operationdynamo.org) and either Afshawn or Farzon will personally reach out to you! Alternatively, you can ping us on the Discord server.

## I'm having an issue with the site?
Please contact us at [support@operationdynamo.org](mailto:support@operationdynamo.org)

## How can I help?
If you are a maker or a doctor or a hospital please reach out and get a referal code. This only works if we can grow this community, so please spread the word. We need to grow both the supply and demand side of this problem. Every share matters in getting part requests matched with makers ready to act.  

## Is there A Discord or Slack?
[Yes!](https://discord.gg/j8jmQsx)

## Are you taking monetary donations?
Not at this time. For now we are funding this service and our own prints out-of-pocket. The next largest upfront cost will be on our maker network. While we are not currently taking donations, we are looking into what it would take to become a non-profit and add that capability so that we can provide a better service to our network of providers and makers. 

## Are you taking *any* donations?
We are also 3D printing enthusiasts. If you are local to Atlanta, we will take your spool if you don't need it. With Amazon slowing the shipping of nonessential items with delivery times up to over a month, we are afraid we might run out of our own spool if we see a large demand for our service. This is why we would like to build a larger network of fellow enthusiasts! The more people who can print, the greater the impact we might have. 

## Are my donations tax deductable?
No, we are not a registered charity and are not taking monetary donations. If you send us printer spool, the value of the printer spool can **not** be deducted from your taxes.

## Where are you operating?
Right now, only in the USA.

## Can I legally contribute?
Yes. In the United States, Good Samaritan laws offer legal protection from civil lawsuits to people who voluntarily provide reasonable aid to those who are injured, ill, in danger, or otherwise incapacitated. A claim of negligent care can also be raised if the injuries or illness were made worse by the volunteer's negligence. Laws generally do not exempt a Good Samaritan who acts in a willful, wanton or reckless manner in providing care, advice, or assistance.

Our site **Operation Dynamo** is a product of <i>Conva LLC</i>, and will take STL files and other specifications from hospitals or healthcare providers in need, and provide you with the specifications you will need to manufacture the necessary items to meet the demands caused by this pandemic. That said, hospitals and providers are responsible for the STL files and you, makers, are responsible for your creations. We want to build good relationships with this community and we want to save lives. That requires all of us to practice due diligence to the best of our abilities.

## What is the current state of the pandemic?
Below are two links i've been using to track COVID-19

## I don't have a 3D printer; are there other ways I can help?
Yes! This virus is an all hands on deck scenario. If you can make masks please do. In Georgia [Phoebe Putney Memorial Hospital]( 
https://www.phoebehealth.com/patients-and-visitors/coronavirus/mask-production?fbclid=IwAR1TcRTYEpWqDn3OGvQ3HMGCMQ0C1FAltie5G9vKzmbTQlxixxWvPHaJuys) is providing instructions on how to make masks and taking them at the address provided in the link.

If you want something more local to the metro area look into [SewingmasksforATL](https://www.sewingmasksforatlantahospitals.com/).

Another great resource is [helphospitals.io](http://helphospitals.io/). They are taking and coordinating the distribution of PPE (Personal Protective Equipment).

Another great resource is [foldingathome](https://foldingathome.org/covid19/). We all have computers and if you can spare a few CPU or GPU cycles please help them crowdsource the analysis of COVID-19 proteins in the search for treatments.

If you would like to help us at **OperationDynamo** on our mission please spread this site on your social media. This effort only works if we can get the visibility of more doctors and hospitals that need our critical service and supplies.
