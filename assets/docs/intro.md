Welcome friends,

Thanks for checking out this site. We face a daunting challenge in the coming weeks. For the first time since WWII car manufacturers are converting assembly lines; this time to build respirators. Our governments and private institutions are mobilizing to combat the COVID-19 pandemic, but it likely won’t be enough. It especially won’t be timely enough for the people who need respirators now. That’s why we are launching **Operation Dynamo**. We want to mobilize a fleet of makers to build parts local hospitals need now for respirators so that they can save lives. Like the Little Ships of Dunkirk we can crowd-source this problem and make an impact as a community. Please join us today by offering your time, your 3d printers, or what you can so we can help save lives.

Thank you,

Afshawn, Farzon, & Nima
